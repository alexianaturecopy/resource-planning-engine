## The Leadership Challenge I Solved

### Problem:
Traditional resource planning suffers from:
- ❌ **Political allocation** instead of ROI-driven decisions
- ❌ **Static annual budgets** that can't adapt to changing priorities
- ❌ **Manual Excel-based planning** taking weeks to complete
- ❌ **No optimization** - just historical + growth%
- ❌ **Poor process quality** leading to 8% defect rates

### Solution:
Built integrated planning engine that:
- ✅ **Optimizes allocation** using constraint-based algorithms (PuLP)
- ✅ **Models scenarios** interactively with real-time recalculation  
- ✅ **Driver-based planning** connecting goals → activities → resources
- ✅ **Six Sigma integration** for process quality improvement
- ✅ **Quantifies trade-offs** transparently for executive decisions

## Key Features

### 1. Strategic Resource Allocation (PuLP Optimization)

**Optimization Engine:**
```python
Objective: Maximize (Investment × ROI × Strategic Priority)

Subject to:
- Total allocation ≤ $18M budget
- Each funded project ≥ minimum viable budget
- Minimum 6 projects funded
- Strategic priorities weighted
- Success probability factored
```

**Business Value:**
- Identifies optimal $18M allocation across 10 service lines
- **Result:** 2.7x blended ROI vs 2.3x with equal allocation
- Quantifies trade-offs between competing requests
- Eliminates political budget negotiations

### 2. Driver-Based Planning Models

**Sales Capacity Model:**
- Revenue target ($10M) → Deals needed → Opps required → Reps needed
- Factors: Win rate, sales cycle, ramp time, quota attainment
- Output: Headcount plan + budget requirements

**Marketing Efficiency Model:**
- New clients target → Opps needed → Leads required → Budget
- Calculates: CAC, LTV:CAC ratio, payback period
- Optimization: Maximize client acquisition within budget

**Operations Capacity Model:**
- Projects/year → Team-days required → Headcount needed
- Factors: Project duration, team size, utilization target
- Output: Capacity plan + cost per project

### 3. Scenario Modeling

**Compare multiple growth scenarios:**
- Conservative (20% growth, 20% margin)
- Base (40% growth, 25% margin)
- Aggressive (60% growth, 30% margin)

**For each scenario:**
- Revenue projections
- Headcount requirements
- Investment allocation
- Expected returns

**Sensitivity Analysis:**
- Revenue sensitivity (±20%)
- Margin sensitivity (15%-35%)
- ROI impact visualization

### 4. Six Sigma Dashboard (DMAIC Framework)

**Define:**
- Critical quality characteristics
- Onboarding ≤14 days, Satisfaction ≥4.5/5, Defects ≤3%

**Measure:**
- Current state metrics
- Onboarding: 21 days (50% over target)
- Defect rate: 8% (167% over target)

**Analyze:**
- Root cause analysis (Pareto charts)
- Top 3 causes = 76% of defects
- Control charts for process monitoring

**Improve:**
- Process improvement initiatives
- Standardized checklists, automation, quality gates

**Control:**
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated alerts for out-of-control processes

### 5. ROI-Based Prioritization

**Scoring Framework:**
- Financial return (40%): ROI × Investment size
- Strategic alignment (35%): Priority score (1-5)
- Execution risk (25%): Success probability

**Output:**
- Ranked project list
- Composite scores
- Funding recommendations

```

### Six Sigma Analysis:
```
Current State:
- Onboarding: 21 days (target: 14 days) - 50% over
- Defect rate: 8% (target: 3%) - 167% over
- Satisfaction: 4.2/5 (target: 4.5) - 0.3pts under
- Utilization: 65% (target: 75%) - 10pts under

Root Causes (Pareto):
1. Unclear requirements: 35% of defects
2. Resource unavailability: 28%
3. Scope creep: 18%
   → Top 3 = 81% of all defects

## For Interviews

### Q: "How do you approach resource allocation?"

**Answer:**
> "I built a resource planning engine that uses constraint-based optimization to maximize ROI. Rather than political budget negotiations or historical-based allocation, it uses linear programming (PuLP library) to find the optimal distribution.
>
> For example, with $18M to allocate across 10 service lines requesting $21.8M, the optimization identifies which combination maximizes expected returns while meeting strategic constraints. The result was a 2.7x blended ROI vs 2.3x with equal allocation - an extra $7.2M in expected value.
>
> The tool also includes driver-based planning models that connect revenue goals to resource requirements, scenario analysis for different growth cases, and Six Sigma process improvement tracking. It's on my GitHub with working code."

### Q: "Tell me about process improvement work you've led."

**Answer:**
> "I integrated Six Sigma methodology into our resource planning to improve operational efficiency. The dashboard tracks DMAIC progress - we defined critical quality characteristics (onboarding time, defect rate, satisfaction), measured current state (21 days, 8%, 4.2/5), analyzed root causes using Pareto analysis, and designed improvements.
>
> The key insight: top 3 defect causes represented 81% of all issues. By focusing on those - unclear requirements, resource allocation, and scope control - we projected reducing defects from 8% to 3%, saving $280K annually.
>
> The dashboard includes control charts for real-time monitoring and automated alerts when processes drift out of spec. It demonstrates how I combine strategic finance with operational excellence."
